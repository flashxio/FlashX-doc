FlashX performs data analytics in the form of graphs and matrices. It runs
in a variety of hardwares and can utilize solid-state drives (SSDs) to scale
to large datasets in a single machine. It has two main components:

* FlashGraph is a general-purpose programming framework with a vertex-centric
programming interface for large-scale graph analysis. FlashGraph is able to
scale to billion-node graphs in a single machine and significantly outperforms
state-of-art distributed graph analysis frameworks at this scale.
* FlashMatrix is a matrix computation engine that provides generalized matrix
operations (GenOps). FlashMatrix uses a small set of GenOps to support a large
variety of matrix operations and express varieties of data mining and machine
learning algorithms. It keeps matrices on SSDs to scale to very large datasets.

FlashX provides the R programming interface to process datasets at a scale of
terabytes with the speed of optimized parallel C code. It provides
users a familiar R programming environment to express many machine learning
algorithms completely in R.
